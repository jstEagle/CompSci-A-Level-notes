- __Pass by Value__ - The compiler copies the value of an argument in a calling function to a corresponding non-pointer or non-reference parameter in the called function definition. The parameter in the called function is initialized with the value of the passed argument. [[Pseudocode]]

- __Pass by Reference__ - To pass the reference of an argument into the calling function to the corresponding formal parameter of the called function. (It directly uses the original value in memory). [[Pseudocode]]

- __Bitmapped Image__ - Also known as a "Raster" image, it is an image that is made of individually stored pixels that form the image. [[Bitmaps]]

- __Vector Image__ - Sometimes also called a vector graphic, it is special because the information about the image is stored in equations and lines of code, this means that unlike bitmapped images, the vector graphic can be scaled without looking pixelated or blurred.

- __Byte__ - A unit of digital information stored in eight bits and treated as a single unit. [[Bitmaps]]

- __Lossless Compression__ - A process that allows files to be compressed and the reconstructed without losing any data or information. PNG, RAW, GIF, ZIP : These are all examples of lossless compression files types. [[Bitmaps]]

- __Reading Questions__ - Always read the questions very carefully, in this course all the questions are usually very sneaky and specific. __PAY ATTENTION__

- __Algorithm__ - A solution to a problem expressed as a series of instructions of steps in an order of operation. [[Algorithms]]

- __Subroutines__ -
Advantages:
- Reusability
- Better Debugging and testing
- No data duplication - i.e. the code for adding 2 numbers does not have to be written several times.
Disadvantages:
- Overhead associated with them can at times hamper the performance of a time critical application.

- __Number Systems__ - Binary, denary, hexadecimal. [[Number Systems]]

- __Nibble__ - a group of four bits. Can be represented by one hexadecimal digit. This means that each byte can be represented by 2 hexadecimal digits.
