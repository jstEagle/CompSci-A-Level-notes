- Ways in which data can be organized
- The ADT provides methods in which data may be <mark class="hltr-purple">added</mark>, <mark class="hltr-blue">deleted</mark> or <mark class="hltr-green">manipulated</mark>

**Can all be implemented via a 1D array**

<u>Include</u>
- Stacks
- Queues
- Linked lists

Really common to implement an ADT via another ADT/data structure.
e.g. implement and ADT via a 1D array.

#### Terms
- Data structure - A way of storing multiple values under one identifier
- Static data structures - fixed size. e.g. array has an upper bound.
- Dynamic data structures - variable size. The number of elements can change as needed.

Dynamic data structures have the advantages of being more memory efficient but are also more complex to code.
