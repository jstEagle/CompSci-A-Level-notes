### Compiler
Takes the entire source code written in a high-level language and compiles it to machine code or low level language all at once. The compilation process checks the entire code for errors and then produces an executable file.

### Interpreter
Processes the source code line by line and executes it immediately. Does not produce any type of output file. Just reads and executes the code on the fly. Allows easier debugging and dynamic code execution.

### Assembler
Converts assembly code into machine code. Translates human readable assembly code (low-level language) to 0's and 1's. i.e. machine code or binary code.
