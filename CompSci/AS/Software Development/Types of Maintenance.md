When software is completed and distributed to the client, software developers are expected to ensure that the software meets the user's requirements.

Maintenance of the software means that the developer's work is not done yet. Feedback from the user is important because the may raise an issue that was not discovered through regular program testing.

These changes are not always the result of bugs that were not previously discovered. There could be external factors that are forced upon the software to meet economic and legal requirements, or the user (client) may require a small change (tweak) to their requirements.


There are **three** types of maintenance that may be performed.


### Corrective
Fixing a bug that was not previously caught in testing methods prior to distribution.

- [ ] Complete 15.08 in the text book.


### Adaptive
Amending the program to include an additional feature.

<mark class="hltr-grey">Example 1</mark>: Adding a 'submit' button to the top of an online form as well as at the end (i.e. enhances functionality of the program)

<mark class="hltr-orange">Example 2</mark>: The user realizes that they really need to print a document produced by the software so the program is amended to include printing functionality (i.e. a small changed to the user's requirements).

<mark class="hltr-purple">Example 3</mark>: Changing the GST rate in a supermarket's checkout system due to a country wide changed in the GST charged.

- [ ] try 15.09 in the text book.


### Perfective 
Without changing the functionality/features of the software, changes algorithms to get more efficiency out of the program (e.g. better time and space complexity).

<mark class="hltr-green">Example 1</mark>: Changing from a bubble sort to a quick sort algorithm.

<mark class="hltr-purple">Example 2</mark>: Making changes to the source code so that no global variables / arrays are used.

<mark class="hltr-blue">Example 3</mark>: Changing a series of IF statements to CASE (switch) when you realized each condition is evaluating the same variable.
