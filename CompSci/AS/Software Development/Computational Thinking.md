- __Decomposition__ - breaking a problem into smaller parts

- __Pattern Recognition__ - applying the same idea to different contexts. e.g. Sorting / searching / finding.

- __Algorithm Design__ - Why we learn different types of algorithm. DIPO structure - Declarations / inputs / processing / outputs.

- __Abstraction__ - Simplifying concepts. Programming, being able to focus on what's important and not trying to do everything at once.
