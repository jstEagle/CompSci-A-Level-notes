  - Base-8 numeral system.
  - Uses eight digits: 0 to 7.
  - Rarely used in modern computer systems but historically significant.

## Significance in Computer Science

### Data Representation

- **Data Representation**:
  - Different number systems are used to represent various types of data (e.g., binary for machine code, hexadecimal for memory addresses, decimal for human-readable numbers).

### Memory Addressing

- **Memory Addressing**:
  - Hexadecimal is often used to represent memory addresses, providing a compact and human-readable format for programmers and system administrators.

### Bitwise Operations

- **Bitwise Operations**:
  - Binary numbers are essential for bitwise operations like AND, OR, XOR, and shifting, which are fundamental in low-level programming and data manipulation.

## Conclusion

Number systems are crucial in computer science, facilitating the representation, manipulation, and communication of data in digital computers. Different number systems are employed for specific tasks, ranging from machine code representation to memory addressing and bitwise operations. Understanding these systems is fundamental for computer scientists and software engineers working at all levels of software and hardware development.
