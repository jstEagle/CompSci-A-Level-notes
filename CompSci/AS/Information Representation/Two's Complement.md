A method used by computers systems to recognize both positive __and__ negative binary integers.

MSB (most significant bit - leftmost bit) has two roles:
1) Place value if a 1
2) Sign bit: + or -
	- MSB 1 = The denary value being represented is negative
	- MSB 0 = The denary value being represented is negative


### Converting negative denary to two's complement binary

1) Convert the denary to binary as if it was a positive value.
2) Flip the bits ([[One's Complement]])
3) Add 1 to the one's complement binary pattern
