## Introduction

Binary to decimal conversion is the process of converting binary numbers (base-2) into decimal numbers (base-10). This conversion is essential for interpreting and working with binary data in a more familiar and human-readable format.

## Binary Number System

- **Binary Number System**:
  - Base-2 numeral system.
  - Uses two digits: 0 and 1.
  - Commonly used in computing for representing digital data.

## Binary to Decimal Conversion

### Conversion Process

To convert a binary number to decimal, follow these steps:

1. **Start from the rightmost digit (least significant bit) of the binary number.**
2. **Assign a place value of 1 to the rightmost digit.** Each digit to the left has a place value that is double the place value of the digit to its right.
3. **Multiply each digit by its respective place value.** If the digit is 1, add the place value to the running total; if it's 0, do not add anything.
4. **Sum all the products obtained in step 3.** This sum is the decimal equivalent of the binary number.

## Examples

### Example 1:
Binary number: 1011

1. Start from the right: 1
2. Place value: 1
3. Multiply: 1 * 1 = 1
4. Sum: 1

Next digit:
1. Start from the right: 1
2. Place value: 2
3. Multiply: 1 * 2 = 2
4. Sum: 1 + 2 = 3

Next digit:
1. Start from the right: 0 (skip)
2. Place value: 4
3. Multiply: 0 * 4 = 0
4. Sum: 3

Next digit:
1. Start from the right: 1
2. Place value: 8
3. Multiply: 1 * 8 = 8
4. Sum: 3 + 8 = 11

So, binary 1011 is equal to decimal 11.

### Example 2:
Binary number: 110010

1. Start from the right: 0 (skip)
2. Place value: 1
3. Multiply: 0 * 1 = 0
4. Sum: 0

Next digit:
1. Start from the right: 1
2. Place value: 2
3. Multiply: 1 * 2 = 2
4. Sum: 0 + 2 = 2

Continue this process for the remaining digits.

## Applications in Computing

- **Applications in Computing**:
  - Converting binary to decimal is essential for interpreting memory addresses, register values, and other binary data in computer architecture.
  - It is useful for debugging and understanding binary data representations in various computer programs.
  - Decimal representation is often more human-friendly, making it easier for programmers and engineers to work with data.

## Conclusion

Binary to decimal conversion is a fundamental skill in computer science, enabling the interpretation and manipulation of binary data in a more accessible format. Understanding this conversion process is crucial for anyone working with digital systems, software development, or computer architecture.
