### Primary memory
Directly connected to CPU

- RAM (working memory)
- ROM
- Cache
- SRAM
- DRAM
- PROM
- EPROM
- EEPROM

- Essential for the running of a computer system
- May be volatile (temporary) or non-volatile (long-term) storage of data (files) and instructions (programs)
- Directly accessed by the CPU

##### RAM
Volatile - if no power is supplied the retained information is lost. Power needs to constantly be supplied to retain contents.

Contents - Open files, Open programs, Parts of the operating system (OS)

##### SRAM
<mark class="hltr-blue">Static RAM</mark>
Keeps data bits in memory as long as power is supplied.

Does not have to be refreshed but is expensive to manufacture. This is because it is built onto a processor. (Cache memory).
This creates much faster read/write speeds in DRAM and it also stores data immediately before and after it is processed by the CPU.

##### DRAM
<mark class="hltr-green">Dynamic RAM</mark>
Each bit is stored using one transistor and one capacitor.

The transistor acts as a switch - controls circuitry on the chip and reads the capacitor's state of charge or changes in charge.
The capacitor holds a high or low charge each corresponding to either a 1 or 0 respectively.

This type of ram is less expensive to produce than SRAM and each chip normally holds Gigabytes worth of storage.

##### ROM
Read-Only Memory
### Secondary memory
indirectly connected to CPU

- Internal - HDD, SSD
- External - External HDD, USB drive, SD card, CD, Floppy disk, magnetic tape, cassette. (Offline)

_______
### Magnetic storage
- <mark class="hltr-green">polarized iron-oxide</mark> particles
- e.g. <mark class="hltr-green">HDD</mark>, floppy disk, magnetic tape

### Optical storage
- data is written and read with <mark class="hltr-blue">lasers</mark>
- 'pits' and 'lands'
- e.g. CD, DVD, Blu-ray discs

### Solid State storage
- Also known as <mark class="hltr-purple">NAND flash</mark>
- no moving parts
- data is stored in flip-flop logic circuits allowing the device to retain the state of each bit even when no powered.
- SSD, SD card, Memory stick
