1. **Data Bus**: <mark class="hltr-green">Bidirectional</mark> - The data bus carries data between components, allowing data to be both read from and written to various devices.
    
2. **Address Bus**: <mark class="hltr-blue">Unidirectional</mark> - The address bus is typically unidirectional, transmitting memory addresses from the CPU to memory or peripheral devices.
    
3. **Control Bus**: <mark class="hltr-green">Bidirectional</mark> - The control bus carries control signals and commands in both directions to coordinate the operations of various components.
    
4. _**System Bus**: It encompasses the data, address, and control buses, so its directionality depends on the individual components involved. Typically, it is bidirectional for data and bidirectional for control signals._
    
5. **I/O Bus (Input/Output Bus)**: <mark class="hltr-green">Bidirectional</mark> - The I/O bus allows data to flow in both directions between the CPU and peripheral devices.
    
6. **Memory Bus**: <mark class="hltr-green">Bidirectional</mark> - The memory bus is bidirectional as it facilitates the transfer of data between the CPU and RAM in both read and write operations.
    
7. **Local Bus**: <mark class="hltr-green">Bidirectional</mark> - The local bus connects the CPU to its cache memory and allows data to be transferred in both directions.
    
8. **Backplane Bus**: <mark class="hltr-green">Bidirectional</mark> - Backplane buses are used for communication between various hardware components and are typically bidirectional.
    
9. **SMBus (System Management Bus)**: <mark class="hltr-green">Bidirectional</mark> - The SMBus is bidirectional and is used for system management and monitoring functions.
    
10. **ISA Bus (Industry Standard Architecture Bus)**: Bidirectional - The ISA bus used to be bidirectional and was used for connecting devices like sound cards and modems in early PCs. However, it's now largely obsolete.
    

Note that while the buses themselves may support bidirectional communication, the specific signals and protocols used on these buses determine how data flows in practice. Additionally, modern computer systems often use high-speed, parallel buses for data transfer within the CPU and memory subsystems, whereas serial buses like PCIe are used for peripheral connections.
