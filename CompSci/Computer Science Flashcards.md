Question:
What are the key components of the Von Neumann Model?
?
Answer:
The key components of the Von Neumann Model include the Central Processing Unit (CPU), Memory Unit, Control Unit, Arithmetic and Logic Unit (ALU), and Input/Output (I/O) Devices.

Question:
What is a linked list in computer science?
?
Answer:
A linked list is a linear data structure composed of nodes, each containing data and a reference to the next node, used for dynamic storage and efficient insertion/deletion of elements.

Question:
How do you create a singly linked list in Java?
?
Answer:
In Java, you can create a singly linked list by defining a `Node` class for elements and a `LinkedList` class to manage them. Example code is provided in the previous responses.

Question:
What is a record type in Java?
?
Answer:
In Java, a record type is a class primarily used for storing data, defined using the `record` keyword. Records automatically generate constructors, accessors, `equals()`, `hashCode()`, and `toString()` methods.

Question:
How do you create a record type for a `Person` in Java?
?
Answer:
You can create a `Person` record type in Java using the `record` keyword and specifying the data fields (e.g., `String name` and `int age`) in the record definition. Example code is provided in the previous responses.

Question:
What are the common number systems in computer science?
?
Answer:
The common number systems in computer science include the Binary Number System (base-2), Decimal Number System (base-10), Hexadecimal Number System (base-16), and Octal Number System (base-8).

Question:
How is data typically represented in the binary number system?
?
Answer:
Data in the binary number system is typically represented using only two digits: 0 and 1, where each digit represents a binary bit.

Question:
What is the primary use of the hexadecimal number system in computer science?
?
Answer:
The primary use of the hexadecimal number system in computer science is for representing binary data in a more compact and human-readable format, commonly used in memory addressing and low-level programming.

Question:
What is SQL in the context of databases?
?
Answer:
SQL (Structured Query Language) is a domain-specific language used for managing and querying relational databases. It allows users to interact with databases by defining, manipulating, and retrieving data.

Question:
What is DML in the context of databases?
?
Answer:
DML (Data Manipulation Language) is a subset of SQL that deals with the manipulation of data stored in a database. DML statements include INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, and SELECT, enabling users to add, modify, and retrieve data.

Question:
What is DDL in the context of databases?
?
Answer:
DDL (Data Definition Language) is a subset of SQL used for defining and managing the structure of a database. DDL statements include CREATE, ALTER, DROP, and TRUNCATE, allowing users to create, modify, and delete database objects like tables, indexes, and constraints.

Question:
How is SQL used in database management?
?
Answer:
SQL is used for various tasks in database management, such as creating and modifying database schemas (DDL), inserting, updating, and deleting data records (DML), and querying data for analysis and reporting.

Question:
Give an example of a DML statement in SQL.
?
Answer:
An example of a DML statement in SQL is:
```sql
INSERT INTO Customers (CustomerName, ContactName, City)
VALUES ('ABC Company', 'John Doe', 'New York');
```

Question:
Provide an example of a DDL statement in SQL.
?
Answer:
An example of a DDL statement in SQL is:
```sql
CREATE TABLE Employees (
    EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    FirstName VARCHAR(50),
    LastName VARCHAR(50),
    DepartmentID INT
);
```

Question:
What is the purpose of the SELECT statement in SQL?
?
Answer:
The SELECT statement in SQL is used to retrieve data from one or more database tables. It allows users to specify the columns they want to retrieve, apply filters, and sort the results, making it a powerful tool for data retrieval and analysis.

Question:
How does DDL differ from DML in SQL?
?
Answer:
DDL (Data Definition Language) is used for defining and managing the structure of a database (e.g., creating tables), while DML (Data Manipulation Language) is used for adding, modifying, and retrieving data within the database (e.g., inserting records or querying data).

Question:
What are some common SQL database management systems (DBMS)?
?
Answer:
Common SQL database management systems include MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle Database, Microsoft SQL Server, and SQLite, among others.

Question:
Give an example of an ALTER statement in SQL.
?
Answer:
An example of an ALTER statement in SQL is:
```sql
ALTER TABLE Employees
ADD COLUMN Salary DECIMAL(10, 2);
```

Question:
What is the primary role of SQL in the development and maintenance of databases?
?
Answer:
The primary role of SQL in database development and maintenance is to provide a standardized and efficient way to define, manipulate, and query data, ensuring data integrity, security, and accessibility.
